# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

- **Accountability:** Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- **Community Focus:** Focusing on what is best for the community

**In Practice:**
- Code reviews focus on the code, not the person
- Disagreements are handled with respect and evidence

## Technical Standards

### Code Conduct

While maintaining respectful interactions, we also uphold technical standards:

**Required:**
- ES3 compliance (no const, let, arrow functions, classes)
- Following AIS framework conventions
- Testing changes in Adobe Illustrator before submission
- Including proper documentation and comments
- Respecting existing code structure and patterns

**Discouraged:**
- Submitting untested code
- Ignoring contribution guidelines
- Making breaking changes without discussion
- Duplicating existing functionality
- Hardcoding values instead of using configuration

**Process:**
- If someone submits non-compliant code, provide constructive feedback
- Point to documentation and examples
- Offer to help with corrections
- Be patient with learners and newcomers
- Recognize that ExtendScript ES3 limitations are unusual

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Code review comments
- Commit messages
- Documentation and wiki
- Email communication with maintainers
- Social media when representing the project
- Community events (online or offline)

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email:** conduct@vexy.art
**Subject:** [CODE OF CONDUCT] Brief description

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

**What to Include:**
- Your contact information
- Description of the incident
- Date and location (URL, commit, issue number, etc.)
- Any supporting documentation (screenshots, links, etc.)

- Whether you've attempted to resolve the issue directly

**Confidentiality:**
- Reports are handled confidentially
- Details are only shared with those who need to know
- Reporters' identities are protected

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining consequences:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Example:**
- Unconstructive criticism in code review
- Minor unprofessional comment
- First-time minor infraction

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**Example:**
- Repeated unconstructive behavior after correction
- Ignoring technical standards after multiple requests
- Pattern of disrespectful comments

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**Example:**
- Serious harassment or threats
- Deliberately submitting malicious code
- Sustained pattern of violations after warning

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

**Example:**
- Repeated serious violations
- Severe harassment or threats
- Intentional security vulnerabilities
- No improvement after temporary ban
