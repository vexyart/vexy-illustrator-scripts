## Highlights

### Favorites (Quality 5)
The cream of the crop - these 7 scripts are exceptional:

1. **Fit Artboards to Artwork** - Professional-grade artboard fitting
2. **Batch Renamer** - Comprehensive renaming with regex, placeholders
3. **Export as PDF** - Batch PDF export with presets
4. **Step and Repeat** - InDesign-equivalent duplication
5. **Go to Line** - VS Code-like text navigation
6. **Color Blind Simulator** - Accessibility testing
7. **Contrast Checker** - WCAG compliance checking

### French-Language Scripts (15 scripts)
High-quality professional tools with French interfaces and comprehensive documentation:

- **Cotation** (Dimensioning) - Quality 4
- **Nettoyage** (Cleanup) - Quality 4
- **Échelle** (Scale) - Quality 4
- **Hachures** (Hatching) - Quality 4
- **Export Choix DPI** (DPI Export) - Quality 4
- **Caractères Spéciaux** (Special Characters) - Quality 4
- **Code Character** (Character Codes) - Quality 4
- **Remove Small Objects** - Quality 4
- And 7 more Quality 3 scripts

All include bilingual PDF documentation.

### Print Production Suite (15 scripts)
Specialized tools for print workflows:

- Imposition layouts (1-up, 2-up, 4-up, 8-up)
- Saddle-stitch booklets (Quality 4)
- Section-sewn binding (Quality 4)
- Trim marks
- Trapping strokes
- Pre-flight checks

### Measurement & Technical Drawing (20+ scripts)
Professional tools for technical work:

- Dimensioning tools
- Scale calculations
- Path length measurement
- Distance and area calculation
- Pixel-perfect alignment checking

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate: Remove Quality 1 Scripts (16 scripts)
These are redundant with built-in features or other scripts:
- Basic text alignment scripts (redundant with alignment panel)
- Simple navigation scripts (redundant with keyboard shortcuts)
- Zoom utilities (redundant with built-in zoom)
- About.jsx, README.md handling scripts

### Review: Quality 2 Scripts (114 scripts)
These should go to `Varia/` folder:
- Simple toggles and utilities
- Creative exploration tools with limited use
- Scripts that may overlap with better alternatives
- Single-purpose scripts with narrow use cases

### Priority: Quality 4-5 Scripts (59 scripts)
Focus refactoring efforts here:
- These provide the most value
- Many are already well-maintained
- French scripts could benefit from English versions
- Print production tools need modern standards review

### Consolidation Opportunities
Several script groups could be merged:

1. **Navigation scripts** - Combine artboard/text navigation into single tools
2. **Cycle scripts** - Merge color/gradient cycling variants
3. **Anchor point selection** - Combine CW/CCW variants
4. **Alignment tools** - Consolidate horizontal/vertical versions
5. **Toggle scripts** - Create unified preferences manager

## Special Folders

### Folders with Multiple Scripts
These folders contain subfolders with additional scripts not fully catalogued:

- `Objects/Arrange/` - Distribution and arrangement utilities
- `Objects/Transform/` - Transformation utilities
- Library folders (`libs/`, `libraries/`) - Shared code modules

### Documentation Folders
Keep in place (do not move):

- `images/` - Icons and assets
- `libs/`, `libraries/` - Shared code libraries
- All PDF documentation files
- `README.md` and `LICENSE` files

## Suggested Folder Structure

└── old/                    (Archive - keep for reference)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Review scripts.toml** - Verify categorizations match your workflow
2. **Test Quality 5 scripts** - Ensure Favorites work in current Illustrator
3. **Decide on Quality 1 scripts** - Confirm deletion list
4. **Plan Quality 2 (Varia)** - Keep, merge, or remove?
5. **Internationalize French scripts** - Create English versions of Quality 4 FR scripts?
6. **Create reorganization script** - Automate file movement based on scripts.toml
7. **Update documentation** - Create user guide for reorganized structure

## File Structure

- **scripts.toml** - Complete catalogue with 351 entries
- **REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md** - This file
- **old/** - Original scripts (untouched)

## Notes

- Several scripts have multiple versions (Lite, Extra, variants)
- Some overlap exists between similar functionality scripts
- French scripts are generally high quality with good documentation
- Print production tools are specialized and valuable
- Many "editor-like" text features (copy line, move line, etc.) are useful
- Measurement and technical drawing tools are professional-grade

## Old2 Folder Analysis (75 LAScripts Framework Scripts)

### Key Findings

All 75 scripts in `old2/` are **LAScripts framework wrappers**, not standalone scripts. They depend on an external framework/library.

**Characteristics:**
- Very short (typically 1-20 lines)
- Call framework functions via `$` namespace and `lascripts` object
- Event-based modifiers (`--lascripts-event-start`) for keyboard shortcuts
- Mostly demo/example code showing framework usage

**Quality Distribution (old2/):**
- **Quality 4:** 1 script (Bootstrap Grid - worth reimplementing)
- **Quality 3:** 15 scripts (useful functionality, should reimplement)
- **Quality 2:** 30 scripts (simple utilities, may reimplement if needed)
- **Quality 1:** 29 scripts (demos, duplicates, framework-specific - archive)

### Old2 Scripts Worth Reimplementing (Quality 3-4)

These 16 scripts have useful functionality that should be reimplemented as standalone:

**Layout & Grids (Quality 3-4):**
1. Bootstrap Grid (Quality 4) - Create Bootstrap responsive grids
2. Guide Margins - Create margin guides
3. Columns - Create column layout guides

**Sizing & Matching (Quality 3):**
4. Height to Artboard - Match object height to artboard
5. Width to Artboard - Match object width to artboard
6. Size to Artboard - Match object size to artboard
7. Height to Selection - Match heights in selection
8. Width to Selection - Match widths in selection
9. Size to Selection - Match sizes in selection

**Text Conversion (Quality 3):**
10. Text All Convert to Outline - Convert all text to outlines
11. Text Convert Area to Point - Convert area to point text
12. Text Convert Point to Area - Convert point to area text

**Paths & Cleanup (Quality 3):**
13. Close All Open Paths - Close all open paths in document
14. Clipping Mask to Artboard - Create artboard-sized clipping mask

**Documents (Quality 3):**
15. Document Color Mode Toggle - Toggle RGB/CMYK

### Old2 Scripts to Archive (Quality 1)

29 scripts are framework demos, duplicates, or framework-specific features:
- All demo/example scripts (Opacity, Height, Width, Set Color, etc.)
- Framework utilities (Action, Set Maker, Reload Extension)
- Duplicates of existing scripts (Random Scale, Ungroup, etc.)
- Framework-specific concepts (Sections, Live Path)

### Recommendation for Old2

1. **Archive all 75 original scripts** - Keep in old2/ for reference
2. **Reimplement 16 useful ones** as standalone scripts using our library system
3. **Skip 29 Quality 1 scripts** - No value as standalone scripts
4. **Evaluate 30 Quality 2 scripts** on case-by-case basis if needed
