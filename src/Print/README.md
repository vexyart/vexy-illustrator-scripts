# Print Category

**Purpose:** Scripts for print production, imposition, and prepress workflows in Adobe Illustrator.

**Script Count:** 0 production scripts (1 deferred)

**Status:** Category created but no scripts completed yet

## Category Overview

The Print category is designated for scripts that handle professional print production workflows, including:

- **Imposition:** Layout multiple pages for printing
- **Trapping:** Color registration compensation
- **Trim Marks:** Cut line indicators
- **Pre-Flight:** Print-readiness checks
- **Registration Marks:** Alignment indicators

## Deferred Scripts

### ImposeSectionSewn.jsx ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFERRED

**Original:** old/Impose/Section-Sewn....jsx (337 lines)
**Quality Rating:** 4 (very useful)
**Reason for Deferral:** Requires external library refactoring

**Dependencies:**
- External library: `../.lib/core.js`
- Custom Dialog class
- Custom FilePicker class
- Complex imposition calculations

**Status:** Deferred to future round requiring library integration work

**What It Does (Original):**
- Section-sewn imposition layout
- Multi-page booklet arrangement
- Professional binding preparation
- Page order calculation for folding

**Re-Implementation Requirements:**
1. Port external library functions to AIS framework
2. Rebuild Dialog class with AIS.UI (or ScriptUI)
3. Rebuild FilePicker with ExtendScript File/Folder objects
4. Preserve imposition calculation logic
5. Test with various page counts and fold patterns

## Print Production Concepts

### What is Imposition?

**Imposition** arranges multiple pages on a single sheet for efficient printing and binding:

- **Purpose:** Maximize paper use, enable proper page order after folding
- **Types:** Saddle-stitch, section-sewn, perfect binding, spiral
- **Benefits:** Cost savings, proper binding, professional workflows

**Example:**
```
8-page booklet on 2 sheets:
Sheet 1: [8][1] | [2][7]
Sheet 2: [6][3] | [4][5]

After folding and binding ‚Üí Pages 1-8 in correct order
```

### Section-Sewn Binding

**Section-Sewn** (also called "signature sewing") is a bookbinding method:

- **Process:** Pages folded into sections (signatures), sewn together through folds
- **Quality:** Durable, lies flat when open, professional-grade
- **Use Cases:** Hardcover books, high-quality publications, archival materials
- **Page Counts:** Typically 16, 32, or 48 pages per section

## Related Scripts

### Existing Trapping Script
- **Strokes/MakeTrappingStroke.jsx** - Create trapping strokes for print (completed)

See: `Strokes/README.md` for detailed print trapping documentation

## Future Print Scripts

**Planned Implementations:**
- Impose Saddle-Stitch (8-up, 16-up layouts)
- Add Trim Marks (crop marks, bleed marks)
- Make Trapping Stroke (completed in Strokes/)
- Pre-Flight checker (color space, resolution, fonts)
- Registration Marks (alignment indicators)

**Priority:** Medium (Quality 4 scripts deferred)

## Print Production Resources

### Industry Standards
- **ISO 12647:** Process control for offset printing
- **PDF/X:** PDF standards for graphic content exchange
- **CGATS:** Color specifications and tolerances

### Adobe Resources
- Illustrator Help: "Printing"
- Technical Guides: Trapping, Color Management
- PDF Specifications: Export for print

### Professional Workflows
1. **Color Mode:** Convert RGB ‚Üí CMYK for offset printing
2. **Bleed:** Extend artwork 3mm beyond trim
3. **Safe Zone:** Keep text 5mm inside trim
4. **Trapping:** Use MakeTrappingStroke.jsx (0.25-0.3mm)
5. **Resolution:** 300 DPI minimum for raster effects
6. **Fonts:** Outline text or embed fonts
7. **PDF/X-4:** Export with proper color profiles

## Modernization Status

- ‚è≥ Scripts Pending: 1 deferred (ImposeSectionSewn.jsx)
- üîÑ External Library: Needs AIS framework integration
- üìã Category Structure: Complete (folder created, README documented)
- ‚úÖ Related Scripts: MakeTrappingStroke.jsx completed (in Strokes/)

## Related Categories

- **Strokes/** - Print trapping (MakeTrappingStroke.jsx)
- **Export/** - PDF export for print production
- **Artboards/** - Multi-page layout preparation
- **Colors/** - Color mode management (RGB ‚Üî CMYK)

## Requirements

**When Scripts Are Implemented:**
- **Illustrator Version:** CC 2019+ (ExtendScript ES3)
- **Platform:** macOS and Windows
- **Document:** Required with multiple artboards
- **Color Mode:** Typically CMYK for print production

## Contributing

If you have print production scripts or improvements to contribute:

1. Review `CONTRIBUTING.md` for coding standards
2. Follow AIS framework integration guidelines
3. Ensure ES3 compliance (no ES6+ syntax)
4. Test with various page counts and imposition layouts
5. Document print production workflows

## Notes

**Empty Category:**
This category exists as a structural placeholder for future print production scripts. The Print/ folder was created during Round 43 when ImposeSectionSewn.jsx was deferred.

**Priority:**
Print production scripts are Quality 4 (very useful) but require significant refactoring effort. They will be implemented when:
1. External library functions are ported to AIS framework
2. Complex UI components are rebuilt
3. Dedicated development session can be allocated

**Alternatives:**
For immediate print production needs:
- Use Adobe Illustrator's built-in print features (File ‚Üí Print)
- Third-party imposition tools (Quite Imposing, Imposition Studio)
- Pre-flight plugins (Markzware FlightCheck, Enfocus PitStop)
