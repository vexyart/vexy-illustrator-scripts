**Purpose:** Scripts for creating visual effects and organic shapes in Adobe Illustrator.

**Script Count:** 3 production scripts

## Featured Scripts

### Metaball.jsx (244 lines) ðŸ†•

**Description:** Create organic metaball-like connections between circular objects using trigonometric curves.

**Features:**
- Organic blob-like connections between circles
- Adjustable connection rate (0-100%)
- Handle length rate control for curve smoothness
- Copies stroke and fill colors from original circles
- Works with any circular objects
- Mathematical curve generation using trigonometry

**Usage:**
1. Create 2 or more circular objects (circles, ellipses)
2. Select all circles you want to connect
3. Run the script
4. Adjust connection rate slider (higher = more connection)
5. Adjust handle length for curve smoothness

**Common Workflows:**
- **Logo design:** Create smooth, organic brand marks
- **Character design:** Connect circular body parts smoothly
- **Abstract art:** Generate flowing, liquid-like shapes
- **UI elements:** Create blob-style buttons and backgrounds

**Technical Details:**
- Calculates angles and distances between circle centers
- Uses BÃ©zier curves with precise handle positioning
- Handles circle size differences automatically
- Distance-based connection detection
