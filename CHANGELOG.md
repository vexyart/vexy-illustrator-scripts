## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Library-first approach:** Creating AIS library before modernizing scripts was essential
2. **Favorites first:** Starting with highest-value scripts built momentum
3. **Comprehensive documentation:** CLAUDE.md guide prevents repeated mistakes
4. **Templates:** ScriptTemplate.jsx speeds up modernization significantly
5. **Cataloging:** scripts.toml provides clear roadmap

### Challenges Encountered
1. **ExtendScript limitations:** ES3-only (no const, let, arrow functions, classes)
2. **LAScripts dependency:** 72 wrapper files need complete reimplementation
3. **French translation:** Requires careful context preservation
4. **Testing overhead:** Each script needs manual Illustrator testing
5. **Unit conversion:** Complex edge cases in measurement scripts

### Improvements for Next Phase
1. **Batch processing:** Group similar scripts for efficiency
2. **Test document:** Create comprehensive test .ai file
3. **Pattern library:** Document common UI/logic patterns
4. **Quality checks:** Automate syntax validation
5. **Progress tracking:** More granular milestone markers
